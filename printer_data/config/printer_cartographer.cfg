canbus_uuid: 892092a6f619 
#    Fill in the UUID that was just recorded           
x_offset: 0                          
#    adjust for your cartographers offset from nozzle to middle of coil
y_offset: 25
#    adjust for your cartographers offset from nozzle to middle of coil
backlash_comp: 0.00612
#   Backlash compensation distance for removing Z backlash before measuring
#   the sensor response.
# 
#   Offsets are measured from the centre of your coil, to the tip of your nozzle 
#   on a level axis. It is vital that this is accurate. 
calibration_method: touch
#    leave this as touch unless you want to use scan only for everything. 
sensor: cartographer
#    this must be set as cartographer unless using IDM etc.
sensor_alt: carto
#    alternate name to call commands. CARTO_TOUCH etc
#scanner_touch_z_offset: 0.05         
#    This is the default and will be overwritten and added to the DO NOT SAVE area by using UI to save z offset
mesh_runs: 2
#    Number of passes to make during mesh scan.

zero_reference_position: 150, 150  # set this to the middle of your bed
speed: 300               #    movement speed of toolhead during bed mesh
horizontal_move_z: 5     #    height of scanner during bed mesh scan
mesh_min: 35, 30         #    start point of bed mesh [X, Y]
mesh_max: 280, 280       #    end point of bed mesh [X, Y]
